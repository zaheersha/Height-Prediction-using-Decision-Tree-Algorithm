# HEIGHT PREDICTION USING THE DECISION TREE ALGORITHM
This Decision Tree Algorithm is a supervised Machine Learning Algorithm where data is continuously divided at each row based on certain rules until the final outcome is generated. hear we are using this decision tree alg to predict the height using the input as age in the form of dataset. And finding the R2score and Root mean square of the following dataset.
